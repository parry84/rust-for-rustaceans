    "# Rust Without the Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust is intended to be a language for systems programming\n",
    "- This chapter shows how to use Rust without the operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opting Out of the Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `core` library doesn’t depend on the operating system\n",
    "- `alloc` depends on dynamic memory allocation\n",
    "- The `std` library depends on `core`, `alloc` and the operating system\n",
    "- The `#![no_std]` attribute allows to opt-out of everything but core language features\n",
    "  - single `std` function can be still used via `extern std`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Memory Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "- dynamic memory is very flexible as it supports allocating variably sized regions\n",
    "- `Vec`, `String`, `Arc` and `Rc` rely on dynamic memory\n",
    "- By default Rust uses the system allocator\n",
    "- `#![no_std]` excludes types that rely on dynamic memory\n",
    "- Provided a custom allocator implementation, some collections are available from the `alloc` crate\n",
    "  - use attribute `global_allocator` to provide an allocator\n",
    "- Alternatively, heapless collections are just large enough preallocated vectors on the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Rust Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust lacks typical runtime features like the garbage collector\n",
    "- But it brings the functionalities below\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Panic Handler\n",
    "\n",
    "- available on targets that supply `std`\n",
    "  - otherwise need to provide a custom implementation with attribute `#[panic_handler]`\n",
    "  - the panic handler function must never return\n",
    "- it:\n",
    "  - invokes the _panic hook_\n",
    "  - unwinds the current thread’s stack or aborts the process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lang_start` function is executed at startup and in turn calls `main`\n",
    "- on embedded systems, a custom implementation must be provided\n",
    "  - decorated with `#[export_name = \"main\"]`\n",
    "  - pay attention to static variable initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Out-of-Memory Handler\n",
    "\n",
    "- it specifies what happens if that global allocator fails to allocate memory\n",
    "- the default behavior of the `std` handler is to print an error message and abort the process\n",
    "- without `std`, a custom handler must be provided and decorated with `#[alloc_error_handler]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Low-Level Memory Accesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- _volatile_ memory operations that cannot be elided or reordered with respect to other volatile operations\n",
    "  - don’t break _memory mapping_\n",
    "  - interrupt handlers won’t observe out-of-order execution\n",
    "- usage of inline assembly is still unstable in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "## Misuse-Resistant Hardware Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `no_std` programs, it is immensely important to use the type system to make illegal states impossible to represent\n",
    "  - `PhantomData` may help\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "- programs could be built for a different _target_ than the _host_ platform\n",
    "- a target triple take the form _machine-­vendor-os_\n",
    "- the target platform also dictates what components of the standard library are available\n"
