    "# Asynchronous programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- an asynchronous operation is one that executes in the background\n",
    "- it’s not always the most appropriate solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## What’s the Deal with Asynchrony?\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPUs spend most of their time waiting for I/O operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- execute only a single operation at a time\n",
    "- hide the I/O waiting (referred to as _blocking_)\n",
    "- easy to work with and simple to reason about\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "- each thread is responsible for executing a particular independent sequence of blocking operations\n",
    "- threads communicate with each other using a synchronization primitives like locks, channels\n",
    "- drawbacks:\n",
    "  - additional complexity due to threads coordination\n",
    "  - context-switching cost\n",
    "- concurrency: the ability to have multiple independent operations that can run interleaved\n",
    "- parallelism: multiple tasks are executing at the same time\n",
    "  - added complexity to handle truly simultaneous access to shared data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- _nonblocking_ interfaces: the result will be available at some later time\n",
    "- In Rust, is a method that returns a `Poll`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardized Polling\n",
    "\n",
    "- to avoid proliferation of polling methods, implement the `Future` trait\n",
    "- Types that implement the `Future` trait are known as _futures_ and represent values that will be eventually available in the future\n",
    "- In general, you should not poll a future again after it has returned `Poll::Ready`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ergonomic Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "- implementing `Future` for a type is fairly complex, and it is rarely done\n",
    "- there are more ergonomic APIs to implement _nonblocking_ interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### async/await\n",
    "\n",
    "- these primitives rely on _generators_\n",
    "- a _generator_ is a piece of code that can be stopped and resumed\n",
    "- when stopped, it saves the state into a compiler-generated data structure\n",
    "- _yielding_: a resumable return\n",
    "- in Rust, at the moment, generators are only used internally???\n",
    "- since generators need to keep state, and they can be nested, they can increase the memory footprint a lot\n",
    "  - this can impact runtime performance due to copy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pin and Unpin\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future types are self-referential\n",
    "- a self-referential type can't be moved safely (moving doesn't update the pointers, so they'll still be pointing at the old memory address)\n",
    "- Pin wraps a pointer and stops its value from moving (unless the underlying type implements `Unpin`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going to Sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "- _executor_: take care of checking if a future can be pulled again\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Waking Up\n",
    "\n",
    "- goal is to poll only when the future can actually make progress\n",
    "- the executor create a `Waker` should be called when the future can again make progress\n",
    "- the `Waker` is passed as a callback to the future\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fulfilling the Poll Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is the future’s responsibility to ensure that something calls wake on the provided `Waker` when the future is next able to make progress.\n",
    "- the leaf futures actually interact with wakers\n",
    "  - the futures that wait for events that originate within the same process can simply call `wake` then the events happen\n",
    "  - the futures waiting for external events provided by the executor crate\n",
    "    - the futures tell the executor which external events they are waiting for within a `Waker`\n",
    "    - the executor ask the operating system if any of the requested resources have new events\n",
    "    - the executor calls `wake` on the corresponding wakers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Waking Is a Misnomer\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Waker::wake` actually signals that a particular future is _runnable_\n",
    "- lets the executor\n",
    "  - known when it can sleep\n",
    "  - avoid polling futures unnecessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks and Subexecutors\n",
    "\n",
    "- The futures in an asynchronous program form a tree:\n",
    "- the roots are called _tasks_\n",
    "- the roots are given to the executor\n",
    "- the executor polls the roots\n",
    "- each future have to choose which of its children future pool, thus behaving as a _subexecutors_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tying It All Together with spawn\n",
    "\n",
    "- a server can be implemented as:\n",
    "  - a future that listens for new connections\n",
    "  - for each incoming connection it spawns a new future to handle it\n",
    "  - such new future is handled by the executor and will run concurrently\n"
