    "# Unsafe Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- People have strong opinions regarding `unsafe` code\n",
    "- it is the for taking advantage of invariants that the compiler cannot check\n",
    "- it is not a way to skirt the various rules of Rust, like borrow checking\n",
    "\n",
    "## The unsafe Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `unsafe` keyword is used to\n",
    "  - mark a function as unsafe (caller must manually ensure that documented invariants hold)\n",
    "  - declare a block of unsafe code (we must know what we are doing inside that block)\n",
    "- _Undefined behavior describes_ the consequences of a program that violates invariants of the language at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Great Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional features are essentially the ability to dereference raw pointers and to call `unsafe` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Juggling Raw Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "- declared with `*const T` and `*mut T`\n",
    "- they don’t have lifetimes and are not subject to the same validity rules of standard `&` references\n",
    "- you can cast a reference to a pointer\n",
    "- raw pointers support pointer arithmetic\n",
    "- many types have utilities to convert to and from raw pointers\n",
    "- they allow casting a type to another one\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Unsafe Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unsafe`’s most commonly used feature is that it enables you to call unsafe functions\n",
    "  - allows calling function implemented within other programming languages like C\n",
    "  - some unsafe operations can be made safe with additional runtime checks\n",
    "  - most uses of `unsafe` rely on a variety of custom invariants (e.g.: manual dropping, in-place dropping…)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Unsafe Traits\n",
    "\n",
    "- unsafe traits aren’t unsafe to use, but unsafe to implement\n",
    "- raw pointers are neither `Send` nor `Sync` (otherwise every type containing a raw pointer would automatically and opaquely `Send`/`Sync`)\n",
    "- the `GlobalAlloc` trait is an `unsafe` trait because implementors must manually ensure correct alignment of data in memory\n",
    "- a trait should be unsafe if safe code that assumes that trait is implemented correctly can exhibit memory unsafety if the trait is not implemented correctly (mark a trait as unsafe when you want the implementor to pay additional attention when implementing the trait)\n",
    "- don’t confuse _safety_ with _correctness_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Great Responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Unsafe Code Guidelines are still a work-in-progress\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can Go Wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unsafe` code that is not ultimately safe is referred to as having undefined behavior\n",
    "- the undefined behavior could materialize as either visible crashes or invisible state corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "- references must never dangle, must always be aligned, and must always point to a valid value for their target type\n",
    "- some primitive type can only assume a finite set of possible values (some compiler optimizations rely on this rule)\n",
    "- types that point to owned memory (like `Box` and `Vec`) are treated as they held an exclusive reference to such memory\n",
    "- the `MaybeUninit<T>` type is used to contain potentially invalid data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Panics\n",
    "\n",
    "- you must ensure that unsafe code is ready to handle panics\n",
    "- panics unwind the current thread (recursively drop locals and return from function until the top level function of the stack)\n",
    "- unsafe operations may produce uninitialized memory that cannot be dropped\n",
    "\n",
    "### Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "- two types that are both `#[repr(Rust)]` may have different memory representations, even if they have the same fields\n",
    "- hence, casting may lead to undefined behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Drop Check\n",
    "\n",
    "- when a generic type implements `Drop`, it must be outlived by its arguments\n",
    "- the `#[may_dangle]` attribute allows to waive that check\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coping with Fear\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manage Unsafe Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- a unsafe code block may have distant effects\n",
    "- the _privacy boundary_ is everything that interacts with the unsafe bits\n",
    "- it's better to encapsulate unsafe code as much as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read and Write Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- ensure to document all the invariants of unsafe code\n",
    "- repeat global invariant for every function related to them\n",
    "- ensure to read carefully the documentation of unsafe code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the interpreted _Miri_ to check for unintended memory operations\n",
    "- use _sanitizers_ to detect erroneous behavior at runtime\n",
    "- add many assertions to unsafe code\n",
    "- Rust safety transitively depends  on the safety of all code (eventually including the unsafe cone). But this also apply to high level languages that adopt the _Ousterhout's dichotomy_\n"
