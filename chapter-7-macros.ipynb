    "## Declarative Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "- defined using the `macro_rules!`\n",
    "- a sort of compiler-assisted find&replace: declare the transformations\n",
    "- invoked as a function, but not all function-like macros are declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Them\n",
    "\n",
    "- to generate repetitive and structurally similar code\n",
    "- generics are generally more ergonomic than macros\n",
    "- if your code changes based on type, use generics; otherwise, use macros\n",
    "\n",
    "### How They Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- a macro defines the output syntax tree given an input sequence of tokens\n",
    "- the macro input must be a sequence of _token trees_ (not necessarily valid Rust)\n",
    "- declarative macros always generate valid Rust as output: this makes Rust macros resistant to misuse\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Write Declarative Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "- consist of two main parts: matchers and transcribers\n",
    "- the order of the matchers matters\n",
    "- if it is difficult to express the pattern with a matcher, try a procedural macro instead\n",
    "- variables defined by a macro matcher are called _metavariables_\n",
    "- _hygiene_: a declarative macro can only affect variables, type, modules and functions that are explicitly passed to it (macro identifiers live in their own separate namespace)\n"
