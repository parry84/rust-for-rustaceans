    "# Foreign function interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- foreign function interfaces (FFI) are used to interoperate with non-Rust code.\n",
    "- `extern` is the main FFI mechanism\n",
    "- FFI can also be used to call another Rust binary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crossing Boundaries with extern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "- names assigned to particular addresses in a given segment of your binary that allow you to share memory\n",
    "- compiler generates unique names\n",
    "- names can’t be random, for FFI purposes\n",
    "- during compilation, the _linker_ replaces symbols with:\n",
    "  - actual memory addresses (static linking)\n",
    "  - code that resolves the reference at runtime (dynamic linking)\n",
    "- `extern` declare a symbol as defined outside the compilation unit (resolved during linking)\n",
    "- `#[no_mangle]` attribute forces to keep the name of the symbol (to expose Rust code outside)\n",
    "- note: static variables are immutable by default (unregarding they are into a `extern` block)\n",
    "- dynamic linking allow easy upgrades and produces smaller binaries, but forces to distribute the right version of the libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- specify how to call a foreign function:\n",
    "  - the structure of the stack frame\n",
    "  - how to pass arguments\n",
    "  - how to return\n",
    "  - how to restore the CPU context\n",
    "- Specified with the `extern` argument\n",
    "- Unlike C, the Rust ABI is not standard (don’t use it to integrate with other languages)\n",
    "- Unwinding generally works only with regular Rust functions\n",
    "- A function’s calling convention is part of its type\n",
    "- Normal Rust code is hard to be used as a compiled library (because of generics)\n",
    "  - produce C-compatible a library instead\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types Across Language Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- type layout is crucial and must be consistent across the boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "- type information is erased upon compilation\n",
    "- use the same convention on both sides\n",
    "- Rust library contains an implementation of C types\n",
    "- more complex types may need manual mapping\n",
    "  - for structs, pay attention to layout and padding\n",
    "  - C-like bitsets don’t work out-of-the-box\n",
    "\n",
    "## Allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "- pointer can be passed through boundaries, but memory must be deallocated by the same allocator\n",
    "  - interfaces may expose freeing functions\n",
    "  - or function may expect the caller to provide allocated memory (better options, but only when size is known in advance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- `extern` functions can be passed as function pointers to other `extern` functions\n",
    "  - e.g.: `extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int`\n",
    "- use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to detect the panic in any `extern` function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "- most of the code that interacts with the FFI will be unsafe\n",
    "- to write safe code, manually enforce the invariants in the safe wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "#### References and Lifetimes\n",
    "\n",
    "- declare as `&mut` a pointer that may mutate outside the boundary\n",
    "- the safe wrapper should declare proper lifetimes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Send and Sync\n",
    "\n",
    "- mark types as `Send` and `Sync` only when documented as thread-safe\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pointer Confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- to mask internal representation, the interface can return an _opaque pointer_ (i.e.: `void *`)\n",
    "- Rust allow defining zero-sized types such as empty structs to wrap them\n",
    "  - will increse the type safety\n",
    "\n",
    "## bindgen and Build Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "- the utility `bindgen` generate Rust bindings from a C header file\n",
    "  - they are platform-specific\n",
    "  - can be integrated into the build script\n",
    "  - `bindgen` works well with `C` but doesn’t support every `C++` feature\n",
    "  - `cbindgen` is the inverse tool that generates `C` bindings for your Rust library\n"
